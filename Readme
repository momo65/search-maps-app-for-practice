I used google maps API and google places API to develop this project.
You can access these 2 APIs through the google API console. 
I used also @ngrx's Redux directly from the start without developing services.

This the url for a chrome extension that you might need to install: Allow-Control-Allow-Origin
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi  .

You need to disable the Allow-Control-Allow-Origin to do the authentication or sign up and to enable it once you are going to add
a place through the '+' button in the map's popup.

The infinite scroll for the visited places works once and then doesn't anymore.
